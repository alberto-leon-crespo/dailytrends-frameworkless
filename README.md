## Getting Started

To start with the project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alberto-leon-crespo/dailytrends-frameworkless.git
```

Then, switch to the `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

## Installation

To install all the dependencies of the project, run:

npm ci

## Docker Configuration

We're using Docker for MongoDB database and Mongo Express for database management and visualization. To configure and run the Docker containers, we use `docker-compose`. Run the following command to configure and run the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The docker-compose configuration uses a .env file for environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of your project and configure your environment variables. Here's a sample configuration:

```
APP_PORT=3000

DATABASE_MONGO_USER=example
DATABASE_MONGO_PASSWORD=example
DATABASE_MONGO_NAME=dailytrends
DATABASE_MONGO_URL=mongodb://${DATABASE_MONGO_USER}:${DATABASE_MONGO_PASSWORD}@127.0.0.1:27017/dailytrends?authSource=admin

PUPPETER_HEADLESS=true
```

Please set `PUPPETER_HEADLESS` to `true` when deploying on servers, as there may not be a screen available for Puppeteer to launch a browser in non-headless mode.

## Seeding and Reading Feeds

Once your Docker containers are up and running, you can populate your database with initial data and read feeds. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm run console:dev -- feeds seed
npm run console:dev -- feeds read
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, run:

```
npm run develop
```

## Database Access

You can access and manage the database using Mongo Express. It can be accessed at: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`

Mongo Express provides a web interface for viewing and editing data in MongoDB.

## Building

To build the application, run:

```npm run build```

This command will clean the dist folder, build the application, and copy the configuration files to the dist folder.

To run the built version of the application, run:
